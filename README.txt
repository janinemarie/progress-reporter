Turn your WordPress install into its own lightweight progress-reporting tool.

== Description ==

Turn your WordPress install into its own lightweight progress-reporting tool. Choose what pages, posts, and custom post
types show in the report based on what's important to you and your project. Use a custom taxonomy to mark pages and
posts with relevant statuses like "needs editing" and "needs a featured image" to keep your progress and needs
visible. Add your own statuses to customize the report, then publish it on the front-end to share with your client
or use it privately to keep track of your own to-dos. Uninstall when it's time to launch!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `progress-reporter.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. You should see the Progress Report admin menu item
appear on the left, near the top.

directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
